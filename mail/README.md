# Full mail client config using mutt

This contains configuration for setting up a fully working mutt setup with
mbsync and imapnotify to receive mails and msmtp to send them. It uses
`pass` to store secrets.

The configuration is anonymized, replace placeholders to suit your needs.
Two examples are provided, one using normal user/password auth, and one
with OAUTH2 authentication for outlook/gmail.

## TODO
- Write documentation about how to setup oauth (please open an issue if you need it now)
